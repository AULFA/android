##### Build Configuration

Select a Module: simplye, openebooks, vanilla...

![config](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gchjcg4d8wjby7m/buildConfiguration.png?dl=1)

Add a Maven goal with the following command. Any other goal which might be added automatically, should be removed.

```
-pl simplified-app-shared,simplified-app-simplye -am clean package -U -P nypl
```

```
-pl simplified-app-shared,simplified-app-openebooks -am clean package -U -P nypl
```

With Adobe DRM (NYPL and licensees only!)

```
-pl simplified-app-shared,simplified-app-simplye -am clean package -U -P nypl,nypl-drm-adobe
```

```
-pl simplified-app-shared,simplified-app-openebooks -am clean package -U -P nypl,nypl-drm-adobe
```


### IntelliJ IDEA 
[Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition), if you prefer using IntelliJ over Android Studio.
After setup with Android Studio, you can use IntelliJ going forward with the following modifications.

##### Build Configuration
Make sure any other goal is removed, only the maven goal should remain.





## Building

#### Without DRM

```
$ mvn clean package
```

#### With DRM (NYPL and licensees only!)

If the application is to be built with support for Adobe DRM, the
the Adobe-provided `ReaderClientCert.sig` files must be placed in
`src/main/assets` for each of the current application frontends.
The build will check for the existence of these files and fail if
they do not exist. 

Once this is done, building the package with Adobe DRM support
enabled is achieved by:

```
$ mvn -P nypl-drm-adobe clean package
```

## HelpStack

If HelpStack is to be used, a configuration file must be provided
in the `assets` directory of the application being built. So, to
enable Zendesk for the `SimplyE` application, create a file at
`simplified-app-simplye/src/main/assets/helpstack.conf` with the
correct URL and credentials:

Configuration for Zendesk:

```
helpstack.gear                 = zendesk
helpstack.zendesk.instance_url = https://nonexistent.zendesk.com
helpstack.zendesk.staff_email  = nobody@example.com
helpstack.zendesk.api_token    = *************
```

Configuration for Desk.com:

```
helpstack.gear                        = desk
helpstack.desk.instance_url           = https://nonexistent.desk.com
helpstack.desk.to_help_email          = nobody@example.com
helpstack.desk.staff_login_email      = nobody@example.com
helpstack.desk.staff_login_password   = *************
```

## Branding And Configurable Features

See [simplified-app-shared/README-Branding.md](simplified-app-shared/README-Branding.md)
