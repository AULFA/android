The cooler in her flower shop is leaking, her neck has swollen to unnatural proportions, her groom is acting distant, and she still doesn&#8217;t know where she&#8217;s actually getting married!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things go from bad to worse when the director of her favorite charity, Protecting Animal Rights, is murdered, and Abby&#8217;s mother becomes the main suspect. Abby&#8217;s wedding worries will have to wait until she&#8212;along with her fianc&#233;, Marco, and an adorable mutt named Seedy&#8212;can nose out who wanted the animal activist put to sleep. But they&#8217;ll have to sort through the long list of suspects quickly, or her mom may be tossed in the slammer before Abby tosses the bouquet....</summary>

Teddy Ruzak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the state shuts him down for practicing detection without a license, Teddy thinks his&#160;investigating days are over. Then he discovers the body of a man outside his office, a homeless man whom he had befriended just the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teddy suspects foul play, but the police think he's barking up the wrong tree. Then his normal befuddlement is exponentially enhanced by two very unexpected--and potentially very dangerous--visitors from the pound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his signature wit and gripping suspense, Richard Yancey has written yet another irresistible page-turner. It is sure to win him and Teddy Ruzak a whole new series of fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary>

    <title>Forty-one False Starts</title>

      <name>Janet Malcolm</name>
    </author>
    <summary type="html">&lt;b&gt;A National Book Critics Circle Finalist for Criticism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deeply Malcolmian volume on painters, photographers, writers, and critics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janet Malcolm's &lt;i&gt;In the Freud Archives &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Journalist and the Murderer&lt;/i&gt;, as well as her books&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;about Sylvia Plath and Gertrude Stein, are canonical in&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;the realm of nonfiction--as is the title essay of this&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;collection, with its forty-one "false starts," or serial attempts&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;to capture the essence of the painter David&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Salle, which becomes a dazzling portrait of an artist.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Malcolm is "among the most intellectually provocative&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;of authors," writes David Lehman in &lt;i&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;"able to turn epiphanies of perception into explosions&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;of insight."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, in &lt;i&gt;Forty-one False Starts&lt;/i&gt;, Malcolm brings together essays published over the course of several decades (largely in &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The New York&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;) that reflect her preoccupation with artists and their work. Her subjects are painters, photographers, writers, and critics. She explores Bloomsbury's obsessive desire to create things visual &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;literary; the "passionate collaborations" behind Edward Weston's nudes; and the character of the German art photographer Thomas Struth, who is "haunted by the Nazi past," yet whose photographs have "a lightness of spirit." In "The Woman Who Hated Women," Malcolm delves beneath the "onyx surface" of Edith Wharton's fiction, while in "Advanced Placement" she relishes the black comedy of the Gossip Girl novels of Cecily von Zeigesar. In "Salinger's Cigarettes," Malcolm writes that "the pettiness, vulgarity, banality, and vanity that few of us are free of, and thus can tolerate in others, are like ragweed for Salinger's helplessly uncontaminated heroes and heroines." "Over and over," as Ian Frazier writes in his introduction, "she has demonstrated that nonfiction--a book of reporting, an article in a magazine, something we see every day--can rise to the highest level of literature."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;'s Best Nonfiction Books of 2013&lt;br /&gt;</summary>

    <title>All Alone in the Universe</title>
    <author>
      <name>Lynne Rae Perkins</name>
    </author>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Before last summer Maureen and I were best friends....At least I think we were. I don't know what happened exactly. As some people who get hit by trucks sometimes say,'I didn't see anything coming.'" &lt;p&gt;When her best friend since the third grade starts acting as though Debbie doesn't exist, Debbie finds out the hard way that life can be a lonesome place. But in the end the heroine of this wryly funny coming-of-age story--a girl who lives in a house covered with stuff that is supposed to look like bricks but is just a fake brick pattern--discovers that even the hourly tragedies of junior high school can have silver linings, just as a house covered with Insul-Brick can protect a real home. This first novel shines--fun, engrossing, bittersweet, and wonderfully unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <title>The Everlasting Story of Nory</title>
    <author>
      <name>Nicholson Baker</name>
    </author>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our supreme fabulist of the ordinary now turns his attention on a 9-year-old American girl and produces a novel as enchantingly idiosyncratic as any he has written. Nory Winslow wants to be a dentist or a designer of pop-up books. She likes telling stories and inventing dolls. She has nightmares about teeth, which may explain her career choice. She is going to school in England, where she is mocked for her accent and her friendship with an unpopular girl, and she has made it through the year without crying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholson Baker follows Nory as she interacts with her parents and peers, thinks about God and death-watch beetles, and dreams of cows with pointed teeth. In this precocious child he gives us a heroine as canny and as whimsical as Lewis Carroll's Alice and evokes childhood in all its luminous weirdness.</summary>

Suddenly packs of pale crouched figures are stalking the darkened subways, monsters prowl Times Square, and the people all around Cal are ... changing. Similar weirdness is happening everywhere, from the dank, cold heart of a West Virginia coal mine to a remote lab in South Dakota -- where a team of government scientists has unwittingly invited something catastrophic into the world -- to the highest levels of power in Washington, D.C. And Cal Griffin is not the only one struggling to comprehend the surreal, devouring chaos surrounding him -- nor the only one who will be forced to accept a new role in this brave new world of nightmare and wonder. For the forces bled from the stilled machines are fueling a consciousness both newly born and ancient -- and more than one unlikely hero will be needed for the titanic battle between the darkness and the light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

Its target: &lt;i&gt;conversos,&lt;/i&gt; Christians of Jewish descent--specifically those who practice Judaism secretly in their homes. The penalty for "crypto-Judaism": Burning at the stake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marisol Garcia, a young &lt;i&gt;conversa&lt;/i&gt;, is hurriedly wed to Gabriel, a civil lawyer working for the Inquisition, in hopes that he will protect her. But she still yearns for the childhood love who abandoned her four years earlier, and she's shocked when he reappears suddenly at her wedding.&lt;br /&gt;When her father is arrested and tortured, Marisol finds herself caught between her love for him and her desire to save the lives of her people. After becoming a favorite of the ruthless Queen Isabella, Marisol discovers a dangerous secret about her former lover, Antonio, and finds herself trapped in a life-threatening web of intrigue. As the Inquisition's snares tighten around her, Marisol's love for Antonio and loyalty to her Jewish family is tested as never before&#8230;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Inquisitor's Wife&lt;/i&gt; reveals the real motivation behind the Inquisition, a frank glance at a "saintly" queen, and the struggles of a maligned people against crushing forces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;It Eats Planets. And It's Here. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;It starts when Venus explodes into a brilliant cloud of dust and debris, showering Earth with radiation and bizarre particles that wipe out all the crops and half the life in the oceans, and fry the ozone layer. Days later, a few specks of moon rock kicked up from the last Apollo mission fall upon a lava crag in Scotland. That's all it takes...&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the ground itself begins melting into pools of dust that grow larger every day. For what has demolished Venus, and now threatens Earth itself, is part machine, part life-form: a nano-virus, dubbed &lt;i&gt;Moonseed, &lt;/i&gt;that attacks planets. &lt;p&gt;Four scientists are all that stand between Moonseed and Earth's extinction, four brilliant minds that must race to cut off the virus and save what's left of Earth--a pulse-stopping battle for discovery that will lead them from the Earth's inner core to a daredevil Moon voyage that could save, or damn, us all.</summary>

Rather than constantly trying to keep up, perhaps it's time for us to slow down, pay attention, and notice what we need for our well-being. For thousands of years, Eastern traditions have taught meditation to help people lead healthier, happier lives. Now, scientific research is confirming that mindfulness can help us cultivate our mental and physical well-being.

    <summary type="html">Nicholson Baker, who &#8220;writes like no one else in America&#8221; (&lt;i&gt;Newsweek&lt;/i&gt;), here assembles his best short pieces from the last fifteen years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Way the World Works&lt;/i&gt;, Baker&#8217;s second nonfiction collection, ranges over the map of life to examine what troubles us, what eases our pain, and what brings us joy. Baker moves from political controversy to the intimacy of his own life, from forgotten heroes of pacifism to airplane wings, telephones, paper mills, David Remnick, Joseph Pulitzer, the &lt;i&gt;OED&lt;/i&gt;, and the manufacture of the Venetian gondola. He writes about kite string and about the moment he met his wife, and he surveys our fascination with video games while attempting to beat his teenage son at &lt;i&gt;Modern Warfare 2&lt;/i&gt;. In a celebrated essay on Wikipedia, Baker describes his efforts to stem the tide of encyclopedic deletionism; in another, he charts the rise of e-readers; in a third he chronicles his Freedom of Information lawsuit against the San Francisco Public Library. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through all these pieces, many written for &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Harper&#8217;s&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The American Scholar&lt;/i&gt;, Baker shines the light of an inexpugnable curiosity. &lt;i&gt;The Way the World Works &lt;/i&gt;is a keen-minded, generous-spirited compendium by a modern American master.</summary>

    </author>
    <summary type="html">In nearly three thousand BBC broadcasts over fifty-eight years, Alistair Cooke reported on America, revealing our country's complexities and idiosyncrasies to a global audience. He was one of the most widely read and widely heard chroniclers of America - the Twentieth Century's de Tocqueville. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, Alistair Cooke, a newly naturalized American citizen, set out to see his country as it was undergoing monumental change. He wanted to "see what the war had done to people, to the towns I might go through, to some jobs and crops, to stretches of landscape I loved and had seen at peace." Working throughout the war, Cooke finished The American Home Front as the atomic bomb was being dropped on Hiroshima. His publisher thought there would be little interest in books on the war, so it was stuffed in a closet. It stayed there for almost sixty years, nearly forgotten, until it was unearthed shortly before Cooke's death in 2004.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The...</summary>

    <title>Introduction to Clustering Large and High-Dimensional Data</title>
    <author>
      <name>Jacob Kogan</name>
    </author>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a growing need for a more automated system of partitioning data sets into groups, or clusters. For example, digital libraries and the World Wide Web continue to grow exponentially, the ability to find useful information increasingly depends on the indexing infrastructure or search engine. Clustering techniques can be used to discover natural groups in data sets and to identify abstract structures that might reside there, without having any background knowledge of the characteristics of the data. Clustering has been used in a variety of areas, including computer vision, VLSI design, data mining, bio-informatics (gene expression analysis), and information retrieval, to name just a few.

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
How do you ignore a ghost?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sparrow Delaney absolutely, positively does not want to be a medium like her six older sisters, her mother, and her grandmother. She does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to see, hear, smell, or talk to ghosts. If she sticks to her rules and doesn't let anyone know that she can do all those things--everywhere, all the time--Sparrow just might pass as a normal tenth grader at her new high school. She makes a new best friend and meets an irritatingly appealing guy in her history class. But when another boy catches her eye, all Sparrow's dreams of being ordinary go up in smoke. Because &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; boy is a dead one--a persistent, charming, infuriating ghost, who won't let her be until she agrees to help him Move On.

    <summary type="html">&lt;em&gt;It's one thing to learn to curtsy properly. It's quite another to learn to curtsy and throw a knife at the same time. Welcome to Finishing School.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourteen-year-old Sophronia is a great trial to her poor mother. Sophronia is more interested in dismantling clocks and climbing trees than proper manners--and the family can only hope that company never sees her atrocious curtsy. Mrs. Temminnick is desperate for her daughter to become a proper lady. So she enrolls Sophronia in Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Sophronia soon realizes the school is not quite what her mother might have hoped. At Mademoiselle Geraldine's, young ladies learn to finish...everything. Certainly, they learn the fine arts of dance, dress, and etiquette, but the also learn to deal out death, diversion, and espionage--in the politest possible ways, of course. Sophronia and her friends are in for a rousing first year's education. &lt;br /&gt;Set in the same world as the Parasol Protectorate, this YA series debut is filled with all the saucy adventure and droll humor Gail's legions of fans have come to adore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary>

    <title>I Am a SEAL Team Six Warrior</title>
    <author>
      <name>Stephen Templin, Howard E. Wasdin</name>
    </author>
    <summary type="html">When the Navy sends their elite, they send the SEALs. When the SEALs send their elite, they send SEAL Team Six--a secret unit made up of the finest soldiers in the country, if not the world. This is the dramatic tale of how Howard Wasdin overcame a tough childhood to live his dream and enter the exciting and dangerous world of Navy SEALS and Special Forces snipers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His training began with his selection for Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S)--the toughest and longest military training in the world. After graduating, Wasdin saw combat in Operation Desert Storm as a member of SEAL Team Two. But he was driven to be the best of the best--he wanted to join the legendary SEAL Team Six, and at long last he reached his goal and became one of the best snipers on the planet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon he was fighting for his life in Africa, hunting the Somalian warlord Aidid. But the mission fell apart when his small band of soldiers found themselves cut off from help and desperately trying to rescue downed comrades during a routine mission. The Battle of Mogadishu, as it become known, left 18 American soldiers dead and 73 wounded.&lt;br /&gt;This is Howard Wasdin's story of overcoming numerous obstacles to become an elite American warrior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">While the atom is universally acknowledged as the basis for most branches of physics, the study of its constituent particles has illuminated significant new areas of research. The behavior of subatomic particles provides crucial information on the structure and nature of atomic nuclei, which in turn reveal much about energy, matter, and often the origins of the universe. Complete with color diagrams and photographs, this volume elucidates the intricacies of this rapidly developing and always compelling field.</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When Cylin Busby was nine years old, she was obsessed with Izod clothing, the Muppets, and a box turtle she kept in a shoebox. Then everything changed overnight. Her police officer father, John, was driving to his shift when someone leveled a shotgun at his window. The blasts that followed left John's jaw on the passenger seat of his car-literally. While clinging to life, he managed to write down the name of the only person he thought could have pulled the trigger. The suspect? A local ex-con with rumored mob connections. The motive? Officer Busby was scheduled to testify against the suspect's family in an upcoming trial. Overnight, the Busbys went from being the "family next door" to one under 24-hour armed guard, with police escorts to school, and no contact with friends. Worse, the shooter was still on the loose, and it seemed only a matter of time before he'd come after John-or someone else in the family-again. With few choices left to them, the Busby family went into...</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;i&gt;B95 can feel it: a stirring in his bones and feathers. It's time. Today is the day he will once again cast himself into the air, spiral upward into the clouds, and bank into the wind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wears a black band on his lower right leg and an orange flag on his upper left, bearing the laser inscription B95. Scientists call him the Moonbird because, in the course of his astoundingly long lifetime, this gritty, four-ounce marathoner has flown the distance to the moon--and halfway back! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B95 is a robin-sized shorebird, a red knot of the subspecies &lt;i&gt;rufa. &lt;/i&gt;Each February he joins a flock that lifts off from Tierra del Fuego, headed for breeding grounds in the Canadian Arctic, nine thousand miles away.  Late in the summer, he begins the return journey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B95 can fly for days without eating or sleeping, but eventually he must descend to refuel and rest. However, recent changes at ancient refueling stations along his migratory circuit--changes caused mostly by human activity--have reduced the food available and made it harder for the birds to reach. And so, since 1995, when B95 was first captured and banded, the worldwide &lt;i&gt;rufa &lt;/i&gt;population has collapsed by nearly 80 percent. Most perish somewhere along the great hemispheric circuit, but the Moonbird wings on. He has been seen as recently as November 2011, which makes him nearly twenty years old. Shaking their heads, scientists ask themselves: How can this one bird make it year after year when so many others fall?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;National Book Award-winning author Phillip Hoose takes us around the hemisphere with the world's most celebrated shorebird, showing the obstacles &lt;i&gt;rufa&lt;/i&gt; red knots face, introducing a worldwide team of scientists and conservationists trying to save them, and offering insights about what we can do to help shorebirds before it's too late. With inspiring prose, thorough research, and stirring images, Hoose explores the tragedy of extinction through the triumph of a single bird.  &lt;i&gt;Moonbird &lt;/i&gt;is one &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;'s Best Kids Books of 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Banished! Tok, the best flyer of all the young ravens, faces a terrible fate. Falsely accused of murder, he must leave the Raven Mountains forever. If he ever returns, he will be put to death by those he once called friends and family. Tok&#8217;s only hope is to reclaim his honor by completing a quest. Long ago, the ravens lived in partnership with the Grey Lords. Can Tok reunite his kind with these legendary hunters? The quest will take him on a perilous journey into dangers he cannot even imagine&#8230; Sharon Stewart was inspired to write Raven Quest when the image of a black raven &#8211; riding on the back of a white wolf in a swirling snowstorm &#8211; flashed across her mind. The story is also grounded in scientific research about ravens&#8217; long-standing relationship with wolves.</summary>

    <title>Rapture Practice</title>
    <author>
      <name>Aaron Hartzler</name>
    </author>
    <summary type="html">&lt;i&gt;Sometimes salvation is found in the strangest places: a true story.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Aaron Hartzler grew up in a home where he was taught that at any moment the Rapture could happen. That Jesus might come down in the twinkling of an eye and scoop Aaron and his family up to heaven. As a kid, Aaron was thrilled by the idea that every moment of every day might be his last one on planet Earth.&lt;br /&gt;But as Aaron turns sixteen, he finds himself more attached to his earthly life and curious about all the things his family forsakes for the Lord. He begins to realize he doesn't want the Rapture to happen just yet--not before he sees his first movie, stars in the school play, or has his first kiss. Eventually Aaron makes the plunge from conflicted do-gooder to full-fledged teen rebel.&lt;br /&gt;Whether he's sneaking out, making out, or playing hymns with a hangover, Aaron learns a few lessons that can't be found in the Bible. He discovers that the best friends aren't always the ones your mom and dad approve of, and the tricky part about believing is that no one can do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;In this funny and heartfelt coming-of-age memoir, debut author Aaron Hartzler recalls his teenage journey to find the person he is without losing the family that loves him. It's a story about losing your faith and finding your place and your own truth--which is always stranger than fiction.</summary>

They were trying to register African Americans to vote as part of the Freedom Summer effort to bring democracy to the South. Their disappearance and murder caused a national uproar and was one of the most significant incidents of the Civil Rights Movement, and contributed to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;p&gt;THE FREEDOM SUMMER MURDERS will be the first book for young people to take a comprehensive look at the brutal murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, through to the conviction in 2005 of mastermind Edgar Ray Killen.</summary>

    <title>Children of War</title>
    <author>

    </author>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;These frank and harrowing true stories of young Iraqi refugees show surprising resilience, as the children try to survive the consequences of a war in which they played no part.&lt;p&gt;In this book, Deborah Ellis turns her attention to the most tragic victims of the Iraq war &amp;#8212; Iraqi children. She interviews young people, mostly refugees living in Jordan, but also a few who are trying to build new lives in North America. Some families have left Iraq with money; others are penniless and ill or disabled. Most of the children have parents who are working illegally or not at all, and the fear of deportation is a constant threat. Ellis provides an historical overview and brief explanations of context, but other than that allows the children to speak for themselves, with minimal editorial comment or interference. Their stories are frank, harrowing and sometimes show surprising resilience, as the children try to survive the consequences of a war in which they played no part...</summary>

    <author>
      <name>Lynda Blackmon Lowery</name>
    </author>
    <summary type="html">&lt;b&gt;A memoir of the Civil Rights Movement from one of its youngest heroes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the youngest marcher in the 1965 voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Albama, Lynda Blackmon Lowery proved that young adults can be heroes. Jailed eleven times before her fifteenth birthday, Lowery fought alongside Martin Luther King, Jr. for the rights of African-Americans. In this memoir, she shows today's young readers what it means to fight nonviolently (even when the police are using violence, as in the Bloody Sunday protest) and how it felt to be part of changing American history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straightforward and inspiring, this beautifully illustrated memoir brings readers into the middle of the Civil Rights Movement, complementing Common Core classroom learning and bringing history alive for young readers.</summary>

Or that Dr. Percy Julian synthesized cortisone from soy, easing untold people's pain? These are just some of the black inventors and innovators scoring big points in this dynamic look at several unsung heroes who shared a desire to improve people's lives. Offering profiles with fast facts on flaps and framed by a funny contemporary story featuring two feisty twins, here is a nod to the minds behind the gamma electric cell and the ice-cream scoop, improvements to traffic lights, open-heart surgery, and more - inventors whose ingenuity and perseverance against great odds made our world safer, better, and brighter.</summary>

    <title>Brown Girl Dreaming</title>
    <author>
      <name>Jacqueline Woodson</name>
    </author>
    <summary type="html">&lt;b&gt;National Book Award Winner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jacqueline Woodson, one of today's finest writers, tells the moving story of her childhood in mesmerizing verse. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#160;&lt;br /&gt;Raised in South Carolina and New York, Woodson always felt halfway home in each place. In vivid poems, she shares what it was like to grow up as an African American in the 1960s and 1970s, living with the remnants of Jim Crow and her growing awareness of the Civil Rights movement. Touching and powerful, each poem is both accessible and emotionally charged, each line a glimpse into a child&#8217;s soul as she searches for her place in the world. Woodson&#8217;s eloquent poetry also reflects the joy of finding her voice through writing stories, despite the fact that she struggled with reading as a child. Her love of stories inspired her and stayed with her, creating the first sparks of the gifted writer she was to become.&lt;br /&gt;&#160;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for Jacqueline Woodson:&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Woodson writes with a sure understanding of the thoughts of young people, offering a poetic, eloquent narrative that is not simply a story . . . but a mature exploration of grown-up issues and self-discovery.&#8221;&#8212;&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;</summary>

Yet without it, life as we live it today would be impossible. Oil fuels our engines, heats our homes, and powers the machines that make the everyday things we take for granted, from shopping bags to computers to medical equipment. Nations throughout the last century have gone to war over it.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, oil influences every aspect of modern life. It helps shape the history, society, politics, and economy of every nation on earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This riveting new book explores what oil is and the role this precious resource has played in America and the world.</summary>
