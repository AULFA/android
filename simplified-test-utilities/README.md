Test Utilities
==============

The `simplified-test-utilities` package implements various
test utilities that try to abstract over the issue of only
having access to JUnit 3 on Android, but JUnit 4 everywhere
else.

The package will be obsolete as soon as Android gets a non-historic
version of JUnit.
